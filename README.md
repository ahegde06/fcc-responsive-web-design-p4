Building a Technical Documentation Page - Further Practice with Responsive Front-End Web Design

From the FreeCodeCamp project description:"Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL."

I decided to present the same documentation while customizing the UI to further experiment with grids and other features.  It's a bit rough around the edges, but functional.
